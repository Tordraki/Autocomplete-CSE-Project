# Autocomplete-CSE-Project
Autocomplete Interface with multiple implementations.
For CSE 373, I completed 3 different implementations of an AutoComplete interface, one using sequential search, the second using binary search, 
and the third using a ternary tree search. These can be used by the HUSKY maps app to give autocomplete results for locations based on what you are typing, or 
analyzing a list of dna sequences.
